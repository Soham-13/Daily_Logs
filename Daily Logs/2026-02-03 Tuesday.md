1. Aussizz Banner Revamp with Mukesh Khant html revamp full according to new nib and allianz banner took around 4 Hours of my time. image confusion between mukesh vikas.
2. the lamma3.1:8b model as api is workingon server and i was able to call the api but for short prompt like "hi, or hello" it work drastically very fast for larger prompt and json making prompt it took arond 15-20 second for the response and another big cause is that it took whole CPU usage to it due to which other services was context switching and due to which one my service has to shut. 
3. Then after i treid the another solution whihc groq api it is same jsut that the model is hosted on their server. and response of that api drastically very fast. llama model is best for this our requrement of aspect analysis of the review. 
4. Now need to create groq api account from nilesh bhai so that i can test its api on review first. discussed this with utkarsh sir and palak sir as well.
